# Beginnings
While applying for jobs, I realized that a big part of what I promote about myself is being a fast learner. 
Unfortunately, I have nothing beyond my GPA to back this up, and furthermore, my public github repos are not very well organized (my master thesis should partially solve this, but I will be applying to jobs before making the relevant repo(s) public). 

Therefore, I figured I could kill two birds with one stone by making a repo, which is to be well structured, document my progress on a new and exciting topic with which I am unfamiliar, and hopefully include some code to illustrate concepts/answer questions I may have underway. 

## The plan
I want to pick a topic within 3D computer vision, of which I know very little, and become familiar enough with it that I could comfortably apply my knowledge of the topic in a relevant machine/deep learning project. 
First, I will outline my plan and explore different topics (as this `.md`-file documents), before deciding on and doing something with a particular topic. 

## What do I know already
I am nearly done with my MSc. Data Science at ETH ZÃ¼rich, where my current GPA is 5.83/6. 
Thus, I am comfortable with many data science topics and the relevant theory, e.g. (2D) computer vision, time series analysis, causality, NLP, ML in genomics as well as "classical" ML and statistics, to name a few. 

However, I have never seen 3D computer vision in any coursework, and the only real academic exposure I have had to it was two days ago when I watched some videos and read some papers listed [here](https://github.com/dragonlong/Trending-in-3D-Vision). I focussed in particular on [a paper on 3D aware GANs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07695.pdf) by Schwarz et. al., which also required I understand the main points in [Differentiable Volumetric Rendering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.07372.pdf) by Niemeyer et. al. However, I still have open questions about both of these papers, as essentially all of the related (earlier) work in both is unknown to me.

## Prospects
There are three levels of success for me in this project:
### Great success
This would be something like making a tutorial on a topic within 3D vision, or even develop upon ideas in the papers I read.
### Regular success
If this repo is well organized and presents what I learn when in an ordely fashion, that is essentially my goal with this project. 
I would like to write journals underway to support this.

### Minimum viable outcome
That I learn something about 3D computer vision, since I actually know very little about it.
