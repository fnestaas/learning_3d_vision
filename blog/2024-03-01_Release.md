# Release
The repo is still not perfect, but I wanted to get it out there and am sticking to the principle of writing a post every time I work on this project.
Yesterday evening, after writing the post, I also changed `plot_model_par_primitives` to be a generator, which allows us to draw the picture continuously as we finish rendering parts of it.
I also wrote some TODOs in the files changed in this commit.
